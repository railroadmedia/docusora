Adding a new semester-pack that does *not* require an AddEvent Calendar
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Add parent-slug to brand-appropriate "*semester-packs-for-calendars*"
    * just the slug of the parent content (the content with the type "semester-pack", parent to the "semester-pack-lessons"). Array is indexed - no key necessary.
    * When adding a new semester-pack that does *not* require an AddEvent Calendar, it is only necessary to add this to the application's config. You don't need to add it to Musora's config. 
1. Commit and deploy the application
        
Adding a new show or semester-pack that *does* require an AddEvent Calendar
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

1. Are you adding a new show, or a semester-pack?
    1. if show, add content type to:
        1. */config/**add-event.php*** → "eligible-types"
        1. */config/**add-event.php*** → "nice-names"
        1. */config/**railcontent.php*** → "types-for-calendars" array
        1. */musora/app/Services/**UrlHelperService**.php* (You'll have to figure out exactly where to put it in here)
        1. if brand is Drumeo, also add to Drumeo's UrlHelperService. Commit changes.
    1. if semester-pack:
        1. create item in brand-appropriate "*semester-packs-for-calendars*"
            * just the slug of the parent content (the content with the type "semester-pack", parent to the "semester-pack-lessons"). Array is indexed - no key necessary.
        1. create item in brand-appropriate "*semester-pack-schedule-labels*"
            * make the key is the parent's slug
            * make the value a string that will be have the dashes replaced by spaces and will be shown in all-caps.    
1. Commit and deploy changes to Musora
1. ssh into Musora (production) container\* and run the following options of the "AddEventCommand" (`$ php artisan AddEvent {application}`)
    1. "*CreateAllCalendarsForBrand*"        
    1. "*getCalendarIdsProduction*" (note that a "*getCalendarIdsSandbox*" command is available)
        1. Copy the resultant array
1. Paste the above copied values into the array of the relevant application's "*config/**add-event.php***" config file.
    * Protip: output is formatted to allow simple replacement of entire array—no need to hunt down and place just the one new item.
1. Commit and deploy changes to the relevant application
1. Does the content for the new type already exist in the CMS?
    * If **NO**, (the content does *not* yet exist) your work here is done—as the content is created it will be synchronized with AddEvent.
    * If **YES**, (the content *does* already exist), then the content was *not* syncronized with AddEvent as it was created, and therefore you must now run a command to update AddEvent's record. 
        1. ssh into Musora (production) container\*
        2. run the artisan command "AddEventCommand" (`$ php artisan AddEvent {application}`)
        3. run the "*syncForBrand*" option

\* to ssh into a production container, from railenvironment_manager container, run the "*kubectlset*" command (`$ r kubectlset`) (Protip: use the alias "kset" (`$ kset`)), selecting the appropriate options when prompted. Then run the "*kubectlExec*" command (`$ r kubectlExec`) (Protip: use the alias "kx" (`$ kx`)).
