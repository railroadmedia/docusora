# Bug Fixing Workflow

## Step By Step

1. Bug is reported in basecamp or through gchat, email, or in person
2. QA (or dev) creates YouTrack issue inside the 'PM - Bug Reports' board
    - Title from report -> youtrack title
    - Brand/app from report -> equivalent youtrack project
    - Severity -> youtrack severity field
    - Youtrack type field -> 'Bug'
    - Paste entire report from basecamp to the youtrack description
    - Paste thread URL in the youtrack description
    - Assign to Caleb or whoever you see fit
3. Developers look in to and try to fix the bug depending on the severity
    - HIGH: Immediately!
    - MEDIUM: In the next few days, usually the following Friday
    - LOW: In the new few weeks or months depending on the issue
