# Bug Fixing Workflow

## Step By Step

1. **Bug is reported in basecamp or through gchat, email, or in person**
<br>

2. **QA (or a developer in some cases) creates YouTrack issue inside the 'PM - Bug Reports' board**
    - Title from report -> youtrack title
    - Brand/app from report -> equivalent youtrack project
    - Severity -> youtrack severity field
    - Youtrack type field -> 'Bug'
    - Paste entire report from basecamp to the youtrack description
    - Paste thread URL in the youtrack description
    - QA assigns issue to them self
<br>

3. **QA tests and tried to replicate issue, adds details to the issue** 
    - QA assigns to Caleb or the relevant developer after its been tested
<br>

4. **Developers look in to and try to fix the bug depending on the severity**
    - HIGH: Immediately!
    - MEDIUM: In the next few days, usually the following Friday
    - LOW: In the new few weeks or months depending on the issue
<br>

5. **Issue progresses through the normal SCRUM states: To Do, In Development, ..., On Production, Complete**
<br>

6. **Once an issue is On Production or Complete, QA reports back to support in the basecamp thread**
