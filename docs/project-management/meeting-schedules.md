# Meeting Schedules

Please contact Caleb or Jame if you have any questions or see any mistakes.

## Times & Timezones

### Work Hours

- In Canada work hours are 8:00 AM -> 4:00 PM.
- In Romania work hours are 8:00 AM -> 5:00 PM.

### Time Differences
- Romania time is 10 hours ahead of BC Canada time, except during daylight savings.

- Both Canada and Romania have a daylight saving time (DST) change.
    - Daylight savings in Romania starts on March 31, and ends on October 27.
    - Daylight savings in BC Canada starts on March 10, and ends on November 3.
    - From March 10 -> March 31, there is only a 9 hours difference between our times.
    - From October 27 -> November 3, there is only a 9 hours difference between our times.

We will try and utilize the daylight savings time gaps where our office hours overlap as best as possible for meetings.  The goal is to meet outside of regular office hours as little as possible.

Generally when we do meet outside of the daylight saving gap, the meeting will start at 7:30 AM Canada time, and 4:30 PM Romania time. Developers in both countries are only at work for half an hour extra outside their normal work hours (if the meeting is an hour long). Feel free to start another day 30 minutes later, or end it 30 minutes early to account for the extra time.

## Scrum Meetings

Scrum meetings will be outlined elsewhere and be dependant on each department. More details coming soon.

## Quarterly Development Department Meetings

Once per quarter the entire developer team will meet for 30 minutes to an hour. The meeting schedule:

1. Setup/greetings.
2. Each team member shares what they have been working on recently, as well as a work related highlight and a personal highlight.
3. Caleb & Jame share team accomplishments and future scheduled projects.
4. We discuss any outstanding issues or share new ideas.
5. Opportunity to share final thoughts or anything else a team member would like to bring up. 
6. Meeting ends.

## Yearly Developer Review Meetings

Once per year each development team member will have a 1 on 1 meeting with Caleb. 

### Meeting questions (subject to change):

- What are your favourite projects or features that you worked on this year?
- What types of tasks or projects do you enjoy working on most?
- What is one new capability that you've developed? Or, what is one capability that you've improved the most? 
- What technologies could we adopt improve our work?
- What improvements or changes could be made to our local development environment to make our lives easier and more efficient?
- Are there any aspects of your job that you do not like? If so, what can the team and I do to mitigate those aspects?
- What policies do you think need to be changed in our team? 
- Do you have any concerns that you would like to bring up about your department, or the company? 
- What are your goals for next year?
- Any other thoughts?

### Meeting agenda

- Review previous years review notes (Caleb will go through them if applicable)
- Go over meeting questions

## Code Review Meetings

See [https://github.com/railroadmedia/docusora/blob/master/docs/code-review/code-review.md](https://github.com/railroadmedia/docusora/blob/master/docs/code-review/code-review.md)

--- 

## Project Retrospective Meetings

Jame or Caleb will arrange these meetings and their agenda manually and notify everyone involved. These meetings may be scheduled at the same time as other meetings in order to be more time efficient. Usually there are 3 main questions to go over:

- Things that went well
- Things that went poorly
- What we need to do differently

--- 

## Meeting Overload

It's likely we will have months where too many meetings are booked. I do not want any team member to have more than 1 meeting every 2 weeks since these meetings can be a huge time commitment. I want to avoid inefficient meetings or meetings that take longer than they should so we will try and be as tight as possible with scheduling and the meeting agendas. We may delay or skip quarterly meetings depending on the situation. The only exception to this is project SCRUM meetings, which will be much shorter and happen on a regular basis.
