# Development Days

Each developer has 5 dev days a week. We have 4 back end developers.   
**We have 20 dev days in a week, or 80 in a a month total.**

### **Calculating Deadline Guide:**

**1. Add up estimated dev days from stories**  
2. Since we spend 1 days worth of work a week doing other things, **add 20%**  
3. Devs take an average of 6.5 weeks off a year, including vacation, being sick, and stat holidays, **so add 13%**  
**4. Add 10% for mid project changes**  
**5. Divide by total developers working on the project**  
**6. You have your total time in working days!**  


### **Formula:**

**Total Dev Days Estimate * 1.20 * 1.13 * 1.10 / Total Devs On Project = Total Working Days Till Deadline**

From working days till deadline you can get the total weeks till project completion by taking the start date,   
and adding **(Total Working Days Till Deadline / 5)** weeks.

### **Example:**

(**50** * 1.20 * 1.13 * 1.10 / **4**) = **19 total working days duration**

Start date = January 1st

Deadline = start date + (18 / 5 = 3.7) weeks

**Deadline = January 26th**
