# Development Team Meeting Schedules

### Important Notes

Our meeting scheduling and outlines are continually improving and evolving. If you prefer other times or days, 
please let Caleb or your meeting leader know. If there is anything specific you would like to present or discuss
in a specific meeting please let your meeting leader know. Meeting leaders may change and evolve over time depending 
on scheduling and responsibilities. I would like to give everyone chances to run their perspective 
meetings at various points.  

Jon C can optionally join any meeting at his discretion if he wishes to get updates on our current
projects and stay up to date with everything going on.  
Bogdan D to either join the FE or BE meetings (or both) at his discretion depending on the projects he is working on.
