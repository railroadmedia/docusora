# Overview

All marketing dev projects exist inside 
the musora Asana team [Marketing-Dev](https://app.Asana.com/0/1199995198037877/overview).
Developers, creative team members, and marketers associated with the project 
should use this same project in Asana. A new Asana project should be created if the project
will take more than a few hours to complete or if the project requires the full workflow 
of design, development, QA, review, deployment. The Asana project is created using the 
[X - Project Template 2021](https://app.asana.com/0/1199995198037881/list) template.
The asana project should always be added to the 
[Dev-Marketing Asana Portfolio](https://app.asana.com/0/portfolio/1200330095730280/list) once its created.

Anyone can get an overview of all ongoing and scheduled projects and see their priority
in the [Dev-Marketing Asana Portfolio](https://app.asana.com/0/portfolio/1200330095730280/list). Checkout the 'List'
 and 'Timeline' tabs.

# Project Stages, Milestones, & Scheduling

Each state of a project has a section (in bold) and associated milestone (underneath).  

The project schedule is based off a 1-month cycle, 22 working days total. Based on the configured project start and
end date, Asana will automatically set the dates for each milestone using the percentages. For example if you set
the project to be over a 2-month period, the amount of working days per milestone will be double what is shown below.

<br>

### 1. Ideation, Planning, Docs & Links (4 working days - 18%)
- Finish marketing project planning
  
### 2. Design/Creative Tasks (5 working days - 23%)
- Finish designs/assets and design review, get approval from project owners

### 3. Front-End Development Tasks (6 working days - 27%)
- Finish coding the front end

### 4. Back-End Development Tasks (1 working day - 5%)
- Finish coding the back end

### 5. QA Testing Tasks & Review Launch (1 working day - 5%)
- Notify marketing & design team that this project is ready for review

### 6. Review Tasks (4 working days - 23%)

### 7. Launch & Post-Launch Review Tasks (1+ working day - 5%)

# Milestones Explained

Each milestone is dependent on the previous one in the list. Once the first milestone is marked complete,
the next milestone will get automatically unblocked and change from 'Blocked' status to 'Unbegun'.
Once a milestone is unblocked, it will be automatically assigned to the relevant person. 
This prevents peoples my tasks lists from getting cluttered with tasks that they are not yet able to
work on.  

1. **Finish marketing project planning**  
Assigned to and completed by project owner.  
The project owner should assign this milestone to themselves.
     
1. **Finish designs/assets and design review, get approval from project owners**

Currently, tasks in here are automatically assigned to Jord P.

# How To Create a New Project or Task

### Is this a project or a small single task?  

The most important question to ask when determining whether you need a full project or just a misc task is:
**Does this require work and coordination from multiple departments?** If so, you should likely use a project.

For example: _'Trent can you please update the top banner on this page to say X instead of Y'_ is a misc task because
it doesn't need any design work. Some tasks which only require a small amount of design work may still only warrant
a misc task.

_'We need a new design and new pages for our trial offers.'_ This should be a project since it will require design,
design review, coding, qa, etc.

When in doubt, create a misc task with the details of your project and post in the
dev-marketing-creative channel, and we'll figure it out together.

<br>

### If it's a small task that will take less than a few hours and does not require the full workflow:
- Check if there is an existing Asana project for wherever you would like to make the update.
  If so, please create a new task in the 'Launch & Post-Launch Review Tasks' section.
- Otherwise, if there is no existing project, please create a new task in the Asana project named 
'Misc Tasks'. Please set a due date or ask the relevant developer to set a due date.

<br>

### If it's a full project that needs the entire workflow:  

1. Review our current projects and timelines inside the
   [Dev-Marketing Asana Portfolio](https://app.asana.com/0/portfolio/1200330095730280/timeline). Before scheduling
   a project please consider other priorities and what is currently being worked on.
   We will tackle priority issues and questions in our monthly dev-marketing meetings or in slack.
   If you are unsure when to schedule a project please post in the dev-marketing-creative slack channel.

2. Create a new Asana project in the [Dev-Marketing](https://app.asana.com/0/1199995198037877/overview)
   team using the **'X - Project Template 2021.2'** template. 
   Please use the project name format: **'Project Name - Brand'**.
   Segment projects from the top level per brand. For example if every brand needs a 'April Promo Updates' 
   project, please make 1 project for each brand assuming the updates are large enough to justify a project.
   
3. Select 'End date' and choose an end date for the project. Typically, we operate on a monthly schedule so 
   if the project is for a promotion that needs to launch to students July 1st, set the end date to July 1st. 
   Please review the Asana portfolio timeline and project priority list before choosing an end date.
   Asana will set the start date automatically to around 1 month before your set end date. If a 1-month timeline
   will not work for this project please let a developer know in the slack channel so they can adjust the dates.

4. Please choose the relevant color for the brand and set it accordingly for the project.

5. Assign yourself as the project owner. Assign yourself to the following milestones:
    - **Finish marketing project planning**
    - **Finish review by marketing/creative team, get approval for final launch from project owner**
    - Please also assign any collaborators if necessary.
      
6. Add this project to the [Dev-Marketing Asana Portfolio](https://app.asana.com/0/portfolio/1200330095730280/timeline)
   using the '**+ Add work**' button.
   
7. Place all planning documentation, outlines, assets, etc inside the
   '**Planning docs, design links, overviews, etc, go here**' task description.
   
8. If the marketers project planning is complete and ready for design or dev, complete the 
   '**Finish marketing project planning**' milestone. 
   This milestone is set up as a dependency which means that other tasks 
   related to design and development will not be triggered to be ready to be started 
   until this planning task is marked complete.
   
9. Notify the dev and creative team in slack that the project has been set up.

...

10. Once design and development is complete, the project will be put on a testing, staging, or hidden production
url for review. A dev will notify the marketing & creative team via the slack channel **'devc-marketing-creative'** 
   that the project is ready for review. The Asana milestone will also automatically be un-blocked.
   
11. Put your feedback and changes in the '**Review Tasks**' section.

12. Once the review is complete, and the project has been given approval for launch 
    by the project owners and the marketing team, complete the 
   '**Finish review by marketing/creative team, get approval for final launch from project owner**' milestone 
    so the developers know to launch the project. 
    This milestone must be completed by the project owner, not a developer. 
    Please also confirm the date for the 
    '**Launch this project to students, notify marketing and creative teams (using slack)**' milestone if the project is 
    not already live on production. 
    The dev team will launch the project at the specified date and notify the marketing team right after its live.
   
...

13. After the project is completely launched, please put all future feedback, change requests, 
   promo closures and updates, etc, in the '**Launch & Post-Launch Review Tasks**' section.
