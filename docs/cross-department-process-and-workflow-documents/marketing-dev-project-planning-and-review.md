# Overview

All marketing dev projects are created inside 
the musora Asana team [Marketing-Dev](https://app.Asana.com/0/1199995198037877/overview).
The developers, creative team members, and markers associated with the project 
should use the same project in Asana. A new Asana project should be created if the project
will take more than a few hours to complete or if the project requires the full workflow 
of design, development, QA, review, deployment. The Asana project is created using the 
[X - Project Template 2021](https://app.asana.com/0/1199995198037881/list) template.

# Asana Setup & Guide

**_IMPORTANT NOTE:_** You need a basic understanding of how dependencies work in Asana to use 
this workflow properly. If you are unfamiliar please read about how they work here: 
[https://asana.com/guide/help/tasks/dependencies](https://asana.com/guide/help/tasks/dependencies).  
  
**TLDR:** When a task is dependent on another task it is marked as 'blocked' 
until that other task is completed. This is very useful for passing work along between team members
and departments. For example, once the default task '_Finish marketing project planning_' is completed,
the '_Finish the designs & creative assets_' task is set as ready to be started and the creative team is 
notified to begin work on the design. In the same manner once the '_Finish the designs & creative assets_' task
is completed, the '_Finish coding the front end_' task is marked as ready to be started, and the dev
is notified they can begin coding.


## Is it a project or a small update?  

**It's a small update that will take less than a few hours and doesn't require the full workflow:**
- Check if there is an existing Asana project for wherever you would like to make the update.
  If so, please create a new task in the 'Post Launch Tasks, Monitoring, Review' section.
- Otherwise, if there is no existing project, please create a new task in the Asana project named 
'Misc Tasks'.
  
  
**It's a full project that needs the entire workflow:**  

1. Create a new Asana project in the 'Dev-Marketing' team using the 'X - Project Template 2021' 
   template.
   
1. If you have not already, review the top guide task for your department 
   'How to use this project template & plan projects - **marketers** - DELETE ME' or 
   'How to use this project template - **devs** - DELETE ME'
   
1. Delete the 'DELETE ME' tasks at the top. Do not delete the other default tasks since they are used in the rest of the
workflow.
   
1. Place all planning documentation, outlines, assets, etc inside the
   'Project overview, documents, design assets, etc - go here' task description.
   
1. If the marketers project planning is complete and ready for design or dev, complete the 
   'Finish marketing project planning' task. 
   This task is set up as a blocking task which means that other tasks 
   such as design and development will not be triggered to be ready to be started 
   until this planning task is marked complete.
