# Overview

All marketing dev projects are created inside 
the musora asana team [Marketing-Dev](https://app.asana.com/0/1199995198037877/overview).
The developers, the creative team, and the markers associated with the project 
should use the same project in asana. A new asana project should be created if the project
will take more than a few hours to complete, or if the project requires the full workflow 
of design, development, QA, review, deployment.
