# 6 Steps To A Successful Development Project

## 1: Features & Requirements
- Story planning
- Design
- Feature lists
- Timeline planning

## 2: Research & Testing
- Research tools and third party code to be used for project
- Test and make final calls on tools and third party code to be used 

## 3: System & API Specifications
- Plan database and caching schemas
- Plan and spec out API requirements for front end
- Figure out any new packages that need to be created and which existing packages need to be used

## 4: Development
- Write the code
- Unit testing
- Functional testing
- Code reviews

## 5: Quality Assurance
- Acceptance testing
- Manual testing
- User/management testing

## 6: Deployment & Monitoring
- Plan & test deployment process
- Deploy project
- Monitor error logs and user bug reports
- Fix bugs
- Code any postponed features or management changes

# Sprint Structure
Since some of these 6 steps overlap each other in terms of a project timeline so its best to split the project in to a fewer amount of sprint types. We use 3 main types of sprints to split up a project.

## 1: Planning Sprints
- Includes steps: 1 (Features & Requirements), 2 (Research & Testing), 3 (System & API Specifications)

## 2: Implementation Sprints
- Includes steps: 3 (System & API Specifications), 4 (Development), 5 (Quality Assurance)

## 3: Acceptance Sprints
- Includes steps: 5 (Quality Assurance), 6 (Deployment & Monitoring)

## Timeline

In general each type of sprint should have its time allocation split like this:

- Planning: 1/4 of total project time
- Implementation: 2/4 of total project time
- Acceptance: 1/4 of total project time

## Example
For example a 2 month project may have one 2 week planning sprint, then two 2 week implementation sprints, then one 2 week acceptance sprint. As a general rule of thumb if we conclude it will take X weeks of implementation for a given project, we should also allocate X weeks for Planning and Acceptance.
