# Welcome to the Visual Guide to Reporting Bugs in YouTrack!

Please note that this guide for quick reference only, and is not the complete documentation on the reporting process. Please see the [full documentation here](https://github.com/railroadmedia/docusora/blob/master/docs/legacy/project-management/bug-reporting-guide-and-examples.md) for more details.

So you've encountered a bug you'd like to report, and you've gathered all the necessary information and have already confirmed that an Issue doesn't already exist for the bug. Your first step is to navigate to the "New Issue in Bug Reports" form, which can be found here: [https://musoraproduct.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/newIssue?project=BR](https://musoraproduct.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/newIssue?project=BR)

If you have a YouTrack account, please ensure you are signed in at this point. Otherwise, proceed as a guest.

Next, the following fields need to be filled out:

**Summary:** This is the title for the Issue, and should be a brief descriptor of the issue at hand. It should be relatively concise, but still allow the Issue to be easily identified among other reports.

**Body:** This is where the issue should be explained, including a detailed description of the issue, reproduction steps, affected users/accounts, devices used, etc. Media such as images and videos can also be pasted or dragged into this box. Please view the ["Bug Report Template"](https://github.com/railroadmedia/docusora/blob/master/docs/legacy/project-management/bug-reporting-guide-and-examples.md) section of the "Bug Reporting Guide and Examples" documentation for a full list of what is required in this section. If you are posting as a Guest, please include your name so that we can follow up should further information be required.

**Support Notes:** This section is for generally for the SE team, and is used for any details that are not relevant to the fixing of the issue, or follow-up actions that need to be taken by SE team members after the issue is resolved. This section can be left blank if there is no relevant information.

**Attachments:** Any files added to the body will be automatically listed here. Additional files can be added via the [+] button.

Next, the following fields need to be assigned from the sidebar:

**Priority:** Select between "Low" "Medium" and "High". Refer to the [full documentation](https://github.com/railroadmedia/docusora/blob/master/docs/legacy/project-management/bug-reporting-guide-and-examples.md) for a guide on determining priority. By default, this value is set to "Low".

**Brand:** Select the brands affected by the issue. Multiple options can be selected here, and please note that the mobile apps are treated as independent brands.

**Report Count:** If an issue appears to only affect a small subset of users, the number of reports can be tracked here. Otherwise, field can be left blank.

Now hit that "Create" button, and you're done!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/railroadmedia/docusora/master/docs/images/brvg_create.gif "Create")

Created Issues can be found on the [Bug Reporting Project](https://musoraproduct.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/agiles/121-12/current), and any additional information regarding an Issue can be added in the comments after it has been created.

And that's it! Once again, this is not designed to be an exhaustive guide and omits important details regarding the required information. Please read through the ["Bug Reporting Guide and Examples"](https://github.com/railroadmedia/docusora/blob/master/docs/legacy/project-management/bug-reporting-guide-and-examples.md) document before making a report.
