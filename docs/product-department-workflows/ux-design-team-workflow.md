### High Fidelity Designs

### Prototyping

### Design Review & Approval



### Which Design Review Process Do I Use? ###
Are there new features, or is this a brand new experience? If yes, we use the long form design review process. If not, use the short form design review process.

## Short Form Design Review Process: ##
1. Review the design brief and clarify any points of confusion with the project owner
2. Create the design in Figma or Live Prototype format based on designer discretion
3. Create a YouTrack update requesting asynchronous review in Figma with a due date
4. If it’s a time-sensitive task (review required within 5 business days) message team members required for review in Slack

### Checkpoint: ###
_Stakeholders: Jord, Mitch, Project Owner_
Stakeholders review the project and submit change requests.

5. Complete the change requests
6. Enter a request for final review in YouTrack

### Checkpoint: ###
_Stakeholders: Jord, Mitch, Project Owner_
Design Lead marks the task as completed, or requests another round of edits. Once a project has approval the designer moves the task’s status to “complete” status and the Product Manager moves the task on to the next team.


## Long Form Design Review Process: ##
Review the design brief and clarify any points of confusion with the project owner
Create a static design in Figma
Create a YouTrack update requesting asynchronous review in Figma with a due date
If it’s a time-sensitive task (review required within 5 business days) message team members required for review in Slack
Checkpoint:
Stakeholders: Jord, Mitch, Caleb, Randy, Project Owner
Once asynchronous design review is complete the Product Manager determines if there is enough disagreement in the Figma review to necessitate a scheduled design meeting. Either way, a change list is created.
Reviewers submit a change list with direction on if a) Another round of flat design is needed, or b) Design can move to a live prototype. Cycle back to step 3 as needed.
Create the live prototypes
Create a YouTrack update requesting asynchronous review in the live prototype with a due date. Use a browser based commenting system for feedback.
