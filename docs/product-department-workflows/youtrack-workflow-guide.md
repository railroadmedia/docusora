# YouTrack Setup Basics

## What Is YouTrack

_A project management tool that can be adapted to your processes to help you deliver great products. 
Track projects and tasks, use agile boards, plan sprints and releases, keep a knowledge base, work with 
reports and dashboards, create workflows that follow your business processes. Never force your process
to fit the limits of a tool again. Unlike other project management tools, YouTrack can be customized to your needs!_

## General YT Basics

YouTrack's most basic element is an **issue**. An issue can be thought of as a task, user story, issue, bug, etc.

YouTrack also has **projects**. Projects contain issues and generally represent a specific project.

**Hierarchy: projects -> issues**

YouTrack also has **boards**. A board is a tabular way to visualise issues using rows and columns. Typically, 
the column name is the state of an issue such as 'to do', 'in progress', 'completed'. Issues can easily be moved between
rows and columns by clicking and dragging. This can be used to change the issue state or any other field/data.
Often times, the row names are the priority or project name. Rows and columns can be configured to any field or value. 
A board can be used for multiple projects.

Boards can contain **sprints** (if configured). A sprint represents a specific set of issues that are relevant to 
a specific time period. Typically, if a team runs on a 2-week sprint, they would choose which issues to tackle in
the upcoming 2 weeks, then complete those issues. Any issues that were not completed would get moved in to the following
2-week sprint. This makes it easy for team members to know what they should be working on and it makes it easy to see
what was completed in previous sprints.
