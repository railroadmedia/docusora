# Code Review

## Goals

The goals of our code review process are:

- To promote openness and give the opportunity to provide constructive criticism and praise.
- To continually increase code/systems quality and maintain our coding standards and styles
- To reduce bugs and issues in code or systems before they are shipped
- To give all team members the opportunity to learn and grow from others work
- To help spark new ideas
- To maintain healthy teamwork
- To reward and promote high quality work

## The Process

There are an endless amount of resources online for code review processes and practices, including detailed outlines from big companies like Google and Microsoft. I have done my best to combine the best aspects of their processes and modify them in a way that will work for us.

### 1. Code reviews will be scheduled weekly.

Instead of choosing a single day and sticking to it every week, I will be scheduling the day of review a few weeks ahead of time, so we can avoid conflicts with deadlines and deploy dates. Code review days will be scheduled in Google Calendar.

### 2. On each code review day only 2 developers will be scheduled for review. The entire development team, including QA, devops, and the developers in marketing will all be reviewing the 2 scheduled peoples work.

This will ensure the code is reviewed by multiple people and if others are away or on vacation there should still always be someone around to perform the review.

### 3. It's up to the scheduled developers to outline how others can easily track down the code they have committed and give a rough overview of what they worked on.

This will prevent code that is still in progress or in a refactoring stage from unnecessarily being reviewed. We should not be critiquing code that is still in the early development phase since most of us worry less about cleanliness and quality in the early stages of development.

### 4. Everyone should make their best effort to give at least a some feedback, whether positive or negative.

Participation is key to a healthy code review process. The only exception to this is if you are away or have critical work to do.

### 5. When the review is finished its up to the people undergoing review to schedule and plan a time to carry out any necessary changes that were brought forth from the review.

### 6. The review process is designed to help us motivate and reward each other.

Please be respectful and mindful of others. If you believe something should be done a certain way you could still be incorrect. We will make important code decisions as a team, not purely based on 1 persons opinion. If there are any lasting conflicts we will either have a vote, or I will make the final call.

### 7. please do not reach out to others directly to criticise them or their work, or to assign them tasks or fixes.

The goal of this process is to ensure all feedback happens in an open place where everyone can learn and provide value. If you have a problem with someone else's work and you are not willing to mention it to the entire team, please reach out to me directly.

## Scheduling

* of every month.

**First week:**
- Caleb (back end dev)
- Jon M (back end dev)

**Second week:**
- Curtis (front end dev)
- Bogdan D (front/back end dev)

**Third week:**
- Roxana (back end dev)
- Trent (front end dev)

**Forth week:**
- Tee (sysops/devops)
- Jon C (QA/automated testing)

**Note: During your scheduled week you are still required to review your partners code. So during week 1 review Jon M and I will still review each others code along with everyone else.**
